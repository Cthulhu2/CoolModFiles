> **Module file** (MOD music, tracker music) is a family of music file formats originating from the **MOD** file format on Amiga systems used in the late 1980s. Those who produce these files (using the software called music trackers) and listen to them form the worldwide MOD scene, a part of the _demoscene_ subculture. 
A **MOD** file contains a set of instruments in the form of samples, a number of patterns indicating how and when the samples are to be played, and a list of what patterns to play in what order.[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_file)
